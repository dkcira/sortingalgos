sorting algorithms in python



## 1

Some simple sorting algorithms implemented in python. Looked up from different sources and re-implemented here.
These are for learning and teaching purposes. Use algos from packages for robus algos.

- **Bubble Sort**: Iteratively compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are out of order. The largest element “bubbles” to the end of the list with each pass.
- **Selection Sort**: Finds the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first element. Repeats this process until the entire list is sorted.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted list one element at a time by inserting each unsorted element into its correct position in the sorted portion.
- **Quick Sort / Partition Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions the list into two sublists based on the pivot, and recursively applies the same process to the sublists.
- **Merge Sort**: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges them back together to obtain the sorted list.
